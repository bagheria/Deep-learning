# Feed-Forward Neural Network

This repository is created for the Deep Learning Reading Group meeting.
Scheduled on December 11

In this meeting we will implement a Feed-Forward Neural Network from scratch (with different hidden layers) using ‘numpy’ library in Python. In this meeting, together, we will try to train the model and adjust the weights!

Please bring your laptop with you and if you don’t have Python you don’t need to install it. You can use Google Colaboratory! (https://colab.research.google.com/)
You can use "!pip install package" it you need to install a package in Google Colab.

To be prepared for the meeting you can take a look at the webpage: https://towardsdatascience.com/neural-networks-from-scratch-easy-vs-hard-b26ddc2e89c7

Please check the source code from ‘nn_numpy_2.py’ file from this repository. In this code we have two hidden layers, for a mini version of mnist dataset (from sklearn library). We will discuss and play with the code in the meeting.

Also, if needed, we will discuss the first part of Chapter 6 of the Deep Learning book. (http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
